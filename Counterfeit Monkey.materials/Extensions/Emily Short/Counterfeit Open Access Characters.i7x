The generic confrontational of the farmer is "look, lady".

Understand "ask [farmer] for [any farmer-carried thing]" as requesting it from (with nouns reversed). Requesting it from is an action applying to two visible things.

The farmer exhibits unhelpfulness.

The farmer knows you-are-possible-customer.

Instead of asking the farmer to try giving a farmer-carried thing to the player:
	try requesting the noun from the farmer.

Definition: a thing is farmer-carried if the farmer carries it.

Carry out requesting it from:

Before buying something from the farmer when the player does not recollect what seems for sale:

[The annoyee] does not quite look convinced, but does not summon the authorities, either.[or][The annoyee] looks less than completely charmed when we once again turn out to be flat broke.[or][The annoyee] more or less ignores us.[stopping]".

Before discussing a purchasing quip when the player does not enclose the bills and the previous quip is a purchasing quip:
	[In other words, we've just failed a buy once]
	say "Let's not push our luck, shall we? If we find some money, we can come back later. At least, you told me you were going to provide the cash. I know I trusted you on that score, because I don't have any." instead.

[A purchasing quip is a kind of performative quip. Understand "purchase" as a purchasing quip.]

To say dubious response:
	say "'[when distrustful]If I can see the col[our] of your money first...? Ah, good then,[at other times]Sure thing,[end when]'";
	now the current mood of the farmer is neutral.

 It is background-information.

[This pointless bit of cheeseshop-style foolishness doesn't really accomplish anything, but for some reason my beta-testers kept coming up with new vegetables to ask him about until I expanded the range of conversation quite a bit. I'm not sure it adds anything other than a note of silliness to this portion of the game; the farmer is effectively a toy, since there are no essential objects among the things he has for sale.]

Section 8 - Backpacking Girl

[The backpacking girl is your basic standard NPC impediment -- much more so than just about any of the NPCs who come after, though both Waterstone and Higgate are fetch-quest NPCs after a fashion.

From a narrative point of view, the backpacking girl is present to establish early on

-- that some people do come to Atlantis as tourists; it's not completely sheltered; on the other hand, their expectations are not the same as those of people used to the island long-term

-- to establish a line in the level of social inappropriateness our protagonist is allowed to show. Violence, no; doing things that may shock, surprise, or distress other characters is, however, allowed within reason. (The backpacking girl doesn't really take any harm from the experience.)

-- to bond Alex and Andra as people who are both, in their own ways, significantly more knowing than she is

The Vatican snowglobe is a real souvenir that some fellow hostel-dwellers in Rome produced with great delight. ]

		say run paragraph on;
		try the backpacking girl trying entering P;
	otherwise:
		if a random chance of 1 in 3 succeeds:
			say run paragraph on;
			try the backpacking girl trying examining the player;
		otherwise:
			say "[one of]She tosses restlessly[or]She turns over[or]She bangs her head against the space where a pillow ought to be[or]She scrubs at her eyes with one hand[at random].[run paragraph on]".


Report the backpacking girl trying dropping the heavy pack:
	say "With a grunt, she shrugs off her pack and puts it on the ground near one of the beds.[run paragraph on]" instead.

Report the backpacking girl trying entering a bed:
	say "She eyes the beds thoughtfully, punches each of the mattresses in turn, and then climbs into the one she's selected.[run paragraph on]" instead.

Report the backpacking girl trying examining a thing:
	say "She checks out [the noun].[run paragraph on]" instead.

Report the backpacking girl trying getting off a bed:
		say "The bed creaks as she rolls off it in unseemly haste. She doesn't meet our eye, but mutters something about needing to go buy something right away." instead.

[Report the backpacking girl trying going to a room (called destiny) when the actor is avoiding:
	record "getting the dorm room to ourselves" as achieved;
	say "A moment later she is gone." instead. ]

Report the backpacking girl trying saying hello to the player:
