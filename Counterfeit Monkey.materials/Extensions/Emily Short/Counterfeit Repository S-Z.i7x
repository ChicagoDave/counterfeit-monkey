Section 16 - Tale


A tale is r-abstract. The heft of a tale is 0. The description of a tale is "It begins with 'once upon a time,' and the letters scroll up delicately through the air when [we] start to read. It weaves a narrative as follows: [paragraph break][i][generated tale][/i]".

Report examining the tale:
	record "Propper Rosehip award for talespinning" as an achievement;
	continue the action.

[Here we want to suggest a timeless but suitably Atlantean fairy tale, which we assemble in pseudo-Proppian fashion. Themes hint at rampant xenophobia, problems with distribution of wealth, concerns about class and democracy, the roles of science and superstition, ambivalence towards organized religion, layers of polytheistic as well as Christian culture, superstitions about language, uncertainty about the behavior of abstract objects and beings, and other problems that presumably were emerging over the past several centuries of Atlantean history.

At the same time, the tale is generative and intentionally reveals its generative nature, rather than just being a cycling set of pre-written tales, for two reasons. One, I like some of the curious themes or idiosyncracies that arise from the automatic generation (e.g., a hero who defeats a robber... using something he himself stole; the hero gives up literacy to appease an angry demon and is rewarded with a mask of words...); two, many of the game's abstracts do have a randomized, unstable quality and I wanted to continue that feel.

Conceptually, this passage also owes a little bit to Andrew Plotkin's Matter of the Monster and to some blog comments from Ian Millington about generating semi-random content. It's not, of course, a particularly elegant implementation of that concept.

Contrast the inciting fable, which needs to have one and just one form.]

A tale-apex is a kind of value. The tale-apexes are t-defeats, t-tricks, t-escapes, t-converts.
A tale-protagonist is a kind of value. The tale-protagonists are t-fisherman, t-farmer, t-banker.
A tale-villain is a kind of value. The tale-villains are t-foreigner, t-thief, t-monster, t-multiple-creature.
A tale-helper is a kind of value. The tale-helpers are t-squid, t-ass, t-beggar, t-spirit.
A tale-gift is a kind of value. The tale-gifts are t-sword, t-dagger, t-gun, t-disguise, t-diversion, t-grace.

	say "Yup, definitely spiced meat."

The tan is an r-abstract. The heft of a tan is usually 0. The description is usually "The col[our] is the col[our] of bronzed skin as found on the beaches of Maui; a lazy, relaxed, year-round tan.". The scent-description of a tan is usually "coconut oil".

The description of the tat is "It looks like the end-of-day leftovers from a particularly ill-fav[our]ed yard sale. What's not broken is dirty, and what's not dirty is in terrible taste. There's a mechanical pencil with no lead, and a kiddie pool that leaks; a stained tablecloth that once had a pattern of squid tentacles on it; a bobble-headed doll representing the head player of the Maiana football team thirteen years ago."

The ten-object is r-abstract. The heft of the ten-object is 0. Understand "ten" or "10" as the ten-object. The description of a ten-object is usually "The number of fingers, the number of toes." The printed name of a ten-object is usually "ten".

The description of the Tao is "It presents itself as one of those circular yin-yang symbols, part black, part white. I'm afraid Atlantean understanding of Asian philosophies is fairly simplistic."

The description of a tap is "It's a tap marked [one of]Hot[or]Cold[at random][if the item described is not part of something], though not screwed into any sort of plumbing fixture at the moment[end if]."

The description of the tape is "It's clear tape, the kind you use to wrap presents or make childhood art projects. I made an entire paper village when I was small, at significant expense in sticky tape."

The printed name of the that-object is "that". Understand "that" or "pronoun" or "demonstrative" or "object" or "object known as 'that'" as the that-object. The description of the that-object is "It's a curious little object, having no particular weight or size; whenever I look at it, I find myself concentrating on something else [--] like, say, at this moment, [the random marked-visible thing which is not the that-object]." The that-object is r-abstract.

The tea is an edible contained fluid thing. The scent-description is "[one of]bergamot[or]smoky Lapsang[or]toasted rice and green tea[sticky random]". The description of the tea is "It manifested steaming hot." Understand "earl grey" or "earl gray" or "lapsang" or "souchong" or "green tea" or "toasted rice" as the tea. [I was very very tempted to put the tea in a vintage tea cup, as I spent part of the summer collecting such cups on eBay for a party, and I had in the process cluttered my brain with a lot of useless information about historical tea cup brands and patterns that clearly needed to go somewhere. But then I realized that it would be kind of a bother implementing the cup separately from the tea, and inconsistent with how other liquid manifestations usually work, and so I decided not to after all. The reader is invited to picture her choice of Aynsley, Paragon, Wedgewood, Royal Albert, Limoges, Lomonosov, etc. tea cup as she wishes.]

Check waving the letter-remover at the tea when the current setting of the letter-remover is "t":
	say "For a flickering moment, the letter-remover very nearly manages to conjure some No Tea in its place." instead.

The description of the tic is "It is manifested as a bit of reflective mylar that flashes and changes shape spasmodically. I can't look at it without wanting to blink and rub my eyes." The tic is r-abstract.

The tick is an insect. The description of the tick is "A flat, black, blood-sucking insect. It's also tiny, smaller than a match. Considering its size I'd be surprised if [we] manage to hold on to it for two minutes without losing it.". The heft of the tick is 1.

[The tick is a problem. It's technically an animal, but it shouldn't act like animals act because it's too small. In fact, it's so small that it's not realistic for the player to be able to hold onto it for long. Fortunately, though, the stick isn't an essential item in the game, so we can afford to lose it. This is one place where I have Alex really step in and take some action if the player doesn't do something: either we change the tick back into the sticky in a few moves, or we lose it.]

Tick-removal is a scene. Tick-removal begins when the tick is enclosed by the location.

Every turn during tick-removal:
	say "[one of]That is, of course, if it doesn't attach to our skin and give us Lyme disease[or]I guess what I'm trying to say here is that I don't want our very own pet tick[or]...Okay, sorry, there's something I just need to do here. Blame my phobias if you will[stopping]."

Tick-removal ends painfully when the time since tick-removal began is 3 minutes. Tick-removal ends well when the tick is marked invisible.

Instead of putting the tick on something:
	say "If [we] set it down, it'll be lost for good."

Instead of inserting the tick into something:
	say "If [we] set it down, it'll be lost for good."

Instead of dropping the tick:
	say "If [we] set it down, it'll be lost for good."

When tick-removal ends painfully:
	if the restoration gel is marked-visible:
		try putting the restoration gel on the tick;
	otherwise:
		now the tick is nowhere;
		say "Whoops, I seem to have lost our tick! Oh well. Here's hoping it has a juicy and eventful life."

The description of the ticket is "It reads ADMIT ONE in large black letters."

The description of the alterna-tit is "It is indeed a severed breast. Maybe a C-cup, creamy-skinned and all, but the fact that it looks like it's been raggedly chopped off by a serial killer really decreases the appeal."

The titan of diarists is a man. The description is "He looks vaguely, non-specifically reminiscent of Pepys. At any rate, the kind of guy who would have gone through the London Fire."


The titer is a contained fluid thing. The description of the titer is "The most dilute detectable solution of some virus. I doubt it can be too dangerous."

The titter is r-abstract and noisy. The description of the titter is "It's just about invisible except as a ripple in the air, but it sounds like a girl laughing behind her hand. Repeatedly."

Instead of listening to the titter:
	say "The titter says, '[titter-noise]!'"

[There's really no need for the randomized laughter here, but then again, why not? It's in keeping with lots of other elements in the game.]

Instead of turning the top-toy:
