Good, you're conscious. We're conscious. I've heard urban legends about synthesis going wrong, one half person getting lost.

Do you remember our name?

Sigil Street
The buildings here are two and three stories, with shops at ground level and elderly apartments above. The shops are closed for the holiday: a typographer's office, tourist boutiques of colorful skirts and ethnic bodices (rarely if ever worn by natives) and t-shirts covered with font designs.

Passing by the reflective window we catch the sight of our single blended body, and it creeps me out.

A narrow alley runs between buildings to the south, while the street continues east.

>We smoothly, and almost without thinking about it, reset your device to be a U-remover. There is a smell of anise, and the mourning dress turns into a morning dress. An outfit of striped trousers and fancy coat, such as men sometimes wear to fancy weddings in the morning.

[Your score has gone up by one point.]

>You have earned 1 point:
  1 point for using the letter-remover

You have not yet removed a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, v, w, x, y, or z from anything.

Ampersand Bend
A bend in the street, which runs west and north. This district combines the old and the new: a small museum in an ancient stone building to the east, a shiny real estate office south. The window of the museum is currently displaying one of its exhibits, a codex.

A temporary barrier blocks this empty street from the busy fair to the north, though there is a door that could be opened with the correct code. From here the gaiety and excitement of the holiday are fairly loud. 

>We run our thumb over the dial, setting the device to an X-remover. There is a flash of psychedelic colors, and the codex turns into a code. A bit of paper on which is written "305."

>A bit of paper on which is written "305."

>We set the wheels of the code-lock to 305.

Click! The barrier door unlocks.

Fair
Today is Serial Comma Day, one of the biggest holidays on the island, and a time when half the police force is off duty while the other half is over-extended. The perfect day to make an escape. The square at the center of town is therefore crowded with people, and there's an overpowering smell of artificial butter and spun sugar.

We are surrounded by kiosks for spell-offs, face-painting, a wheel to spin for prizes, and other activities best for small children or the very easily amused. 

The Fair continues with a selection of carnival games to the west, and with open park to the north and east.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now four.]

>It's the sort of game where you spin the wheel for a prize. No one seems to be manning or using it any more, though; perhaps the supply of prizes has run out.

>We reset the device to w. We wave the W-remover at the wheel and produce a heel, severed (because after all it would be beyond the parameters of the change to generate the person whose body part it is). It is only moderately gory, and most locals get used to seeing this kind of thing as a prank from six-year-olds every halloween. Still, it might startle a tourist.

>We take the heel. Calloused and leathery, a gruesome souvenir of years of unhappy shoe-wearing.

>Midway
Here in front of the pharmacy in the southwestern corner of the town square, various contests have been set up — a strong-man hammering contest, a contest to see who can burst the most balloons using a styrofoam dart-plane, and so on.

I assume you've noticed, though, the word-balance, which comes up as high as our hip. On the right pan is an apple and on the left a pear.  

Beside the word-balance is a barker in a blue suit, the same regulation blue used by the Bureau of Orthography. The barker has a tube. 

"One tube of restoration gel goes to the first person who can unbalance the word-balance!" cries the barker, glance sweeping the crowd.

We want to ask what the gel is worth, ask whether the game is rigged, or ask whether anyone ever wins.

>We reset the device to p. There's a smell of fermenting apple, then cider, then something more malty. In the apple's place there is now a glass of nutbrown ale.

There is a cheer from the spectators. The word-balance tilts slowly but inexorably.

The barker looks astonished and displeased, except for a fraction of a second when he just noticeably winks. With exaggerated bad grace hands us some restoration gel. "There's your prize. And now this contest is over."

He stalks away.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now seven.]

>We get the pear. Handsome and green.

>We reset the device to e. There is a smell of anise, and the tube turns into a tub. Now a handsome, giant-sized tub with RESTORATION GEL prominently emblazoned on the front.

>We open the tub, revealing some restoration gel.

>We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the pear. With an audible SPLORT, the pear becomes a pearl. It is small, slightly uneven, and pale blue in color. Not worth very much, but genuine.

I'm starting to understand how you got into all the places you got into. Not that I judge you or your line of work, of course. 

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now eight.]

>We just touch a coated fingertip of gel to the ale. With an audible SPLORT, the ale becomes an apple. 

>We get the apple. Red-cheeked and rosy.

>We reset the device to l. The pearl gives way to the now-familiar pear.

>We reset the device to p. We wave the P-remover at the pear and produce an ear, severed.

We are surrounded by kiosks for spell-offs, face-painting, and other activities best for small children or the very easily amused. 

The Fair continues with a selection of carnival games to the west, and with open park to the north and east.

>We have a brief walk among the booths of the fair. 

Church Garden
One might expect a graveyard, but burial inside the city walls has been forbidden for sanitation reasons since well before the New Church was built. Instead, there is a small meditation garden, which was once designed as an intricate knotwork of shrubs.

The knotwork has since grown into a thicket. 

>We reset the device to h. The thicket abruptly shrivels and flattens itself, and in its place a ticket flutters to earth.

>ticket: We get the ticket. It reads ADMIT ONE in large black letters.

>It's a fair walk pushing through the dense crowds. 

Hostel
I take it this is where you stayed from the time you got to town until our operation. I would have expected that someone with your credentials would have been able to afford something better: The Fleur d'Or, maybe? But maybe you thought this was lower-profile. At least it's clean and doesn't smell funny.

The desk attendant is sort of eying us. She doesn't recognize you — us — but that's a good thing, I think.

Discarded in one corner is Guidebook to Anglophone Atlantis. 

There's a spiral staircase that leads up to the dormitory rooms.

>
Dormitory Room
Painted off-white, with hard wood floors under many layers of protective gloss coating: there are no surfaces in this room that would take a stain. Four dorm beds are lined up against the wall.

The locker you identify as your own sits near one of the beds, still locked with its dial lock.  

A girl of about 19 is standing in the middle of the room, looking around as though she can't quite believe where she landed or what she's doing here. She is carrying a heavy pack and wearing a pink t-shirt. 

"Hey," says the girl. "Do you think this place is safe?" she asks conspiratorially.

I must look blank, because she goes on, "I saw this documentary once, right, about a serial killer who went from youth hostel to youth hostel, grooming girls and killing them. And then he'd chop up the bodies and put the body parts into the lockers. And no one would find out until he'd gone away again."

Nothing like that has happened around here, but she seems to get a charge out of scaring herself with this story.

I'd like to ask for privacy.

>It's curious, now you look at it: it's a combination lock with a dial face, but no one has bothered putting any numerals onto the dial.

Something makes you think of making your lock.

[MEMORIES will list your currently active memories]
>Galley
You were going through the galley cupboards on the yacht. "If you're looking for coffee, Slango forgot to resupply," Brock said, descending the galley staircase in a wet Speedo.

"No, the first-letter razor," you replied, holding up a portable clock. "I need a lock that responds to restoration gel but nothing else."

"Ah." Brock toweled his hair. "It's in my bunk, sorry. Want to come look for it?"

You smiled — a give-away smile. "Wish I could, but we're on a deadline. Go put some pants on. And bring me the razor."

Then we're back in the present.

>The backpacking girl is watching our every move with unconcealed curiosity, which makes me a little hesitant to do anything with the locker.

"Do you like this place so far?"

We could approve of Atlantis or ask for privacy.

>She is just the sort of tourist who most annoys the locals, but actually I find her type a little endearing: she may not be very sophisticated yet, but she wants to expand her horizons, and that's more than you can say for most of the friends she probably left back at home.

>"Check this out," we say, holding out the ear for inspection.

The backpacking girl obviously might faint. After a moment to regain her composure, she flees the vicinity.

>The dial turns smoothly — much too smoothly. There are no clicks, no tiny ticks of inward mechanisms working. By the feel of it, there might be no real locking device here at all.

>Still no numbers on the dial. My mother had a wristwatch like that once. Always a nuisance.

There's a spiral staircase that leads up to the dormitory rooms.

>We greet the desk attendant.

"Yeah, I see you," she says.

I'd like to ask how to unlock the lockers or ask whether we can keep the guidebook.

>"Hey, so, like," we begin, twirling our hair in one finger. "What if I, like, accidentally locked something in the locker upstairs and I don't know the number to get it open? It is, like, so important that I get my stuff back."

Her expression of dreamy good will hardens into one of cool contempt. "Lockers are the responsibility of the guests," she says. "You brought the lock, so you must know the combination."

I'm inclined to ask whether we can keep the guidebook or ask what happens if the guest does not remember.

The locker you identify as your own sits near one of the beds, still locked with its dial lock.  

>We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the lock. With an audible SPLORT, the lock becomes a clock and falls to the ground. It appears to be one of those archetypal alarm clocks that crows at sunrise and generally makes a nuisance of itself. It shows the time to be about half past nine.

>We acquire the clock.

>Now that the lock has been removed, the locker swings easily open, revealing a roll, a letter, and some plans.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now eleven.]

>roll: We pick up the roll.
letter: We take the letter.
plans: We take the plans.

>It's a letter from your brother, printed off anonymously from an untraceable email account that you accessed in town. Nothing that could be followed back to Slango and the yacht.

Sis,

I'm keeping your wire transfer funds. I want to try for Stanford.

I'd say thank you except that, one, you didn't get it legally (I saw this documentary about teen prostitutes — if that's where it came from then EW) and, two, honestly? You owe for what you put us through after you ran away. Mom and Dad were humiliated that you turned into the prodigal daughter. Your face got on milk cartons. Pastor Hughes GAVE A SERMON ABOUT IT.

Mom spent all that time coaching you through spelling practice, you know she doesn't enjoy getting up at 4 AM, right? You totally threw that in their faces.

If you want to come home sometime, fine, but don't come to just see me. If you want to see me you have to see Mom and Dad too.

Nate.

>Currently on your mind is making your lock. 

[REMEMBER any memory to review it.]
>The plans are rolled up and stuck shut with a label that reads "PROPERTY OF DENTAL CONSONANTS LIMITED — UNAUTHORIZED USE ILLEGAL". They're just a set of prints from the main computer design, of course, but still extremely informative: to the right engineer, they might reveal the secret of T-insertion for replication by other companies. These are what you and Brock were originally contracted to lift from the island, at a fee in the multiple millions.

>We reset the device to l. There is a distinct spearmint flavor, and the plans turn into some pans. A set of flat skillets in cast iron: extremely bulky and heavy.

We can't reasonably carry the whole stack of pans, so they fall to the ground with a dramatic crash.

>We reset the device to s. There is a flash of psychedelic colors, and the pans turn into a pan. An omelet-sized skillet in cast iron.

>We take the pan.

Heritage Corner
This patch of the town square has been paved over in octagonal bricks and is commonly used for displays of traditional dancing: over-50 women in home-made embroidered aprons, skipping arm-in-arm and jumping over broomsticks.

No, there aren't any here now. But trust me. It's an unforgettable sight.

Under a bit of shelter in the corner, a diorama table shows scenes from local history, rotated out each week. This week's diorama represents the first sitting of the Committee for the New Orthodox Orthography. 

The park continues to the north and west; to the east is the hostel.

>
Fair
The square at the center of town is crowded with people, and there's an overpowering smell of artificial butter and spun sugar.

We are surrounded by kiosks for spell-offs, face-painting, and other activities best for small children or the very easily amused. 

The Fair continues with a selection of carnival games to the west, and with open park to the north and east.

>We have a short walk among the crowds. 

Cinema Lobby
This is a small, one-screen theater. The seats are not comfortable and the screen is not large. The projector is old. The management is lazy. No food is served.

On two occasions, the film I was watching burst into flames while it was being shown.

Despite these handicaps, it maintains an active and interested clientele simply by virtue of content: a wide variety of foreign films that, though meticulously dubbed into flawless California-accented English, nonetheless carry that slight tang of the forbidden.

Evidently the next showing is not for a little while yet, because there are no patrons in sight.

"Ticket," says the ticket-taker automatically.

>(the ticket to the ticket-taker)
"Here, have a ticket," we say.

The ticket-taker frowns slightly as he takes the ticket. He turns it over front and back; looks at us in confusion; looks at the ticket again. Then he goes to the phone and makes a call.

I'm nervous. It's evident that he's talking to his manager. He doesn't take his eyes off us for a moment. He puts his hand over the mouth of the receiver so that we can't hear the whole conversation clearly, but the gist is still obvious: "...be fake... but... a TRICKET maybe? or, like, a STICKET? ...oh, all right."

Finally he hangs up.

"Sorry for the inconvenience," he says. "Your ticket looks a little different from our usual ones, but I guess the printing has been changed."

He tears the ticket briskly into confetti, destroying all evidence of our crime, and points off to the west. "The screening room is that way. Thank you and enjoy the show. It's not for a while, though."

>
Screening Room
Whatever is scheduled for later showing has not started yet, and is probably not destined to start for some time; at any rate, the screen is blank and no audience has yet assembled.

My backpack is stowed under a seat in the third row from the back. I figured that it would be undisturbed there for a couple of hours, in the dark and out of sight, and if anyone found it they would probably turn it in to Lost and Found. But it is a big relief to find it still there.

The backpack contains a flash drive and a monocle. 

We can go north and east to the Cinema Lobby from here.

>backpack: We get the backpack. Mine: a little bit worn, but capacious. It doesn't have any identifying marks on it, and I thought a brand-new bag would look more suspicious. It's closed.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now fourteen.]

>We open the backpack.

>(first taking the monocle)
Everything turns computer-monitor green when viewed through our right eye. And staring fixedly at anything will turn up its authenticity status.

>
Projection Booth
The booth is small and lined with grey carpet. It smells faintly of hot dogs.

A jotter is propped up next to the projector.

>We take the jotter. It's a little spiral-bound notebook, the kind reporters in old movies carry. It's full of notes: running times of movies. Numbers of people in the audience. Who clapped during potentially subversive scenes. Who arrived in a group of more than three.

>We walk away from the crowds and the fair and over the top of the old walls. 

Hesychius Street
As the street names make obvious, this part of town was laid out in a different political age, when it was considered more important to commemorate linguistic richness than to standardize practices.

This is also the edge of the richest part of town, with houses — really, almost villas — that were built for households with servants. My parents' place is just a block or two north of here.

On holidays like today, this street is often host to a farmer's market; though it is now late enough in the day that most of the farmers have given up and gone home, taking with them their twenty-three varieties of pickled olives, their loganberry jam, and their pigs'-feet-in-aspic.

One remaining farmer lazes here, watching his stall.

>We greet the farmer.

The farmer makes a little cluck sound which seems to mean that he sees us but doesn't care to waste an entire syllable on acknowledging it.

We want to ask what is for sale.

>"What is for sale?" we ask.

"All that's left this time of day is some asparagus, a lime, and a yam," the farmer replies.

I'd like to recommend other vegetables.

>(from the farmer)
"I'll have the asparagus, please," we say.

"Sure thing," says the farmer.

We want to recommend other vegetables.

>(from the farmer)
"I'll have the lime, please," we say.

"Sure thing," says the farmer.

I'm inclined to recommend other vegetables.

>We reset the device to m. The lime flickers and there is a brief image of a lie in its place — the concept strangely embodied in a physical form — before the power gives out. I guess your device there just isn't tuned to reify abstracts.

We want to recommend other vegetables.

>
Webster Court
Hesychius Street opens here into a broad and plainly-paved court.

Lending its name to the location is a bronze statue of Noah Webster. My mother likes to irritate my father by quoting what his contemporaries called Webster: a "viper", a "maniacal pedant", and (always a favorite at Reform Day parties) "a toad in the service of sans-culottism". She makes sure to pronounce that in the most Parisian accent possible.

The large building just to the north — yes, the one in pale pink — is my parents' home. I think I mentioned that my parents were well off. My father works for the Bureau, embarrassingly, and my mother was born into the kind of money that we like to pretend doesn't exist on this island.

The streets continue south, east, and west; and just to the northeast is my parents' side garden.

>
Patriotic Chard-Garden
A narrow strip of land between the house and the edge of my parents' property. The eastern edge runs right up to the decaying old wall of the city, which here means some stumpy masonry on this side and a dizzying drop on the other.

The rest of their terraces and gardens are fenced off.

A little chard still grows in the nearest bed, carefully tended to thrive in this climate. 

Because it's so linguistically productive, chard is something of a national symbol; and during the world wars, there was a fad of gardening at home. After the war, it became common for affluent people with a little bit of land to keep their garden, so that if you were down on your luck you could glean a few leaves.

>We pick the chard, leaving bare soil behind.

A flicker of curtains from inside the house suggests that someone saw us — a cleaner, possibly. But then there is a voice, not audible except as a confident rising and falling tone; this will be my mother, saying not to worry and not to interfere.

Webster Court
A broad and plainly-paved court, named for the statue of Noah Webster.

The large, pale pink building north of us is my parents' home. 

The streets continue south, east, and west; and just to the northeast is my parents' side garden.

>Crumbling Wall Face
The wall once continued north from here some distance before curving northwest around the remainder of the city. So much has crumbled away, though, that the walkway is impassable north of this point. To protect citizens, there is a safety railing across the broken edge.

A metal ladder of four rungs descends the inner face of the wall, allowing pedestrians access to the streets to the west.

Among the rubble fill of the wall is an odd spiral-shaped rock. 

>We pick it up. The spiral rock turns out to be a fossil, from one of those sea creatures long ago.

>We reset the device to s. There is a mad-scientist cackle, and the fossil turns into a foil. One of those long springy swords used for fencing. It has a button at the tip to prevent harm to one's opponent.

There is a dismissive blatt from the monocle, and transposed over the foil is a faint, greenish image of a fossil.

>We reset the device to f. With a distinct whiff of mechanics and the summer time, the foil turns into some oil. A can of what appears to be motor oil. It is sludgy and black.

There is a dismissive blatt from the monocle, and transposed over the oil is a faint, greenish image of a fossil.

>It's a brief hike down from the walls and through the wide peaceful streets where the rich live. 

Roget Close
A pleasantly sheltered lane in which I learned to ride a bicycle, and where my friend Lucy used to live, before she and her parents moved off-island. Restrictions were looser even twenty years ago. Our old schoolhouse is just west of here.

If you look just north between the houses, you'll notice also the footpath down to an almost-private beach. It used to be open, but it's now gated off, and built into the gate is a chic modern sculpture. 

>We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the pan. With an audible SPLORT, the pan becomes some plans. 

>We reset the device to l. The plans give way to the now-familiar pans.

We can't reasonably carry the whole stack of pans, so they fall to the ground with a dramatic crash.

>(first taking the pans)
We put the pans on the pedestal.

The mirror rotates in leisurely fashion, and when it is done there is a snap.

It sounds like a whole chorus of guys in hair gel, snapping for all they're worth.

There is a dismissive blatt from the monocle, and transposed over the snap is a faint, greenish image of some plans.

The gate clicks open. 

The snap makes an, er, snapping noise.

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now fifteen.]

>We walk through the wealthy neighborhood to Roget Close. There we slip between the houses and down a path that looks as though it might lead to someone's back yard. No one has ever put up signage to correct this misapprehension because no one who lives around here is eager to encourage strangers on the private beach.

Soon, however, the footpath begins to descend purposefully towards the level of the ocean.

We continue down until there is a chink of a view of the sea. Then the path descends through a few last hairpin twists among rocks, and comes out suddenly on a little beach.

Private Beach
This is little more than a strip of fine yellow sand, perhaps twenty meters from side to side, and five from the hillside to the waterline. A little sage grows on the hillside, escaped from some garden, along with wilder plants. Above, at the top of that slope, are houses with balconies overlooking the sea, but from this angle it's impossible to see much of them, or for them (you'll have to take my word on this) to see us.

Something green and plastic just barely pokes out of the sand. 

Snap! goes the snap.

>We pick up the funnel. A gaudy green plastic toy suitable for funneling water and shaping conical sand-turrets. A few grains of sand still cling to it.

The snapping continues.

>We reset the device to n. With a distinct whiff of volatile fumes, the funnel turns into some fuel. It looks like a generic canister of unleaded gasoline.

There is a dismissive blatt from the monocle, and transposed over the fuel is a faint, greenish image of a funnel.

The snapping continues.

>We have a quick hike to Webster Court. 

Webster Court
A broad and plainly-paved court, named for the statue of Noah Webster.

The large, pale pink building north of us is my parents' home. 

The streets continue south, east, and west; and just to the northeast is my parents' side garden.

The door to my parents' house opens and my father comes out. He's talking over his shoulder: "Sorry, dear, but someone has to be on call."

My mother answers from inside, but we can't make out what she's saying.

"Surge on the grid," Father replies. "Could be an unauthorized synthesizer, but more likely... yes, exactly. I'll try to be home before the fireworks."

He closes the door behind him.

Hastily I take off our monocle and palm it. Father shouldn't recognize us in our current body, but wearing expensive Bureau equipment in his presence would be a terrible idea.

We put the monocle into the backpack.

We don't dare drawing father's attention. I'm going to have us stand over here as though checking on the health of the neighbor's lawn, shall I?

>We hold our breath.

My father sees us from a distance and gives a neighborly wave. "Happy Punctuating!" he shouts.

I wave back rather weakly.

He gets on his small red scooter, checks his helmet, and revs off to the south. Off, apparently, to investigate the synthesizer that put us together. That will go slowly because of the holiday, but I'm guessing there will be Bureau investigators crawling all over the south side of old town in an hour or two.

The snapping continues.

>It's a brief walk out of the cocooning silence of the wealthy streets and back among the fair booths. 

High Street
Hustle, bustle, dirt; ugly American chain shops; lots and lots of people. There seems to be a large organized protest in progress: protesters completely cram the sidewalk to the southeast.

The curb is lined with garbage. 

To the west, the street turns into a monumental staircase leading to the old fortified area; a cross street heads southeast towards the main roundabout.


Achievement accomplished: Finished tutorial mode!
From a loudspeaker nearby comes the electronic sound of simulated bells ringing the hour after noon. It's later than I thought. We'd better get a move on.

The snapping continues.

>We reset the device to h. With a distinct whiff of crisp, snappy cardboard, the chard turns into a card. Not a playing card, as I might have expected, or a calling card, or even an index card, but a Tarot card, representing the Chariot. The vehicle is drawn by two prize horses, one black, one white. The driver appears to be having some difficulty keeping them together, to judge from the surly expression and the raised whip.

The snapping continues.

>We reset the device to d. With a distinct whiff of metal parts and oil, the card turns into a car. It is little larger than a toy, but that is what you want when driving on the streets around here. Any substantial vehicle wouldn't fit down the winding drives.

Here is how my mother gets around. She takes a 300 Euro Hermès scarf with an orange border and a pattern of prancing horses. She tosses it in the air. As it falls, she shoots it twice, like a clay pigeon: once to take out the F, the second time for the S. And such a car: buttery leather seats, jaguar lines. If someone asks how she gets such good results, she jokes that it's because of her quality materials.

Suffice it to say that we are not similarly blessed.

The car is far too large for us to carry, and falls onto the ground.

The snapping continues.

>I deeply fear automotive maintenance, but I can (just) manage to pour in the fuel... and I think that's done it.

>We reset the device to b. There is a lavender cloud, and the garbage turns into a garage. It is a small but well-furnished garage for minor tuneups and repairs. It even comes with a mechanic: a surprising touch, since letter-removers are usually legally prevented from creating living persons, but sometimes there are glitches if the people are not created directly.

In the garage is a mechanic.

The mechanic nods at us.

The snapping continues.

We could ask why the car does not run.

>We say hi.

The snapping continues.

My response would be to ask why the car does not run.

>"There appears to be something wrong with my car," you tell the mechanic.

He has the somewhat cow-like expression of all fake people, but he nods gravely and has a look. "It hasn't been maintained," he says, on inspection. "You got any motor oil?"

The snapping continues.

>"Will this work?" We hold out the oil.

"Should do," he says. Rolling up his sleeves, he goes to work on the car. There is no small amount of banging and muttering, but finally he stands back and announces that he believes it is now in working condition.

The snapping continues.

We want to thank the mechanic.

Fish Market
Not very fishy at the moment, in fact: all the real trade happens in the early morning; then there is a period of tourist trade when the seafood sale tails off and most of the purchases are of polished conch shells and starfish; and then a little after noon the area clears out completely, leaving only briny rivulets on the concrete.

A tall, stern woman is standing in the middle of the market. She wears the black caped uniform of an Authenticator, and a monocle just like mine. And I don't think I want her to see us. 

Just east of here is a rusting corrugated tin building, which was built to house various possessions of the fishermen. 

This is too dangerous — we've got to get under cover before she sees us.

[Your score has gone up by five points and is now twenty-six.]

>While the Authenticator's back is turned, we slip inside...

Tin Hut
Most of the light in here comes from circular windows punched into the tin walls just under the ceiling. From the inside, the building looks both larger and more sound than it appears from outside: there are plenty of sturdy struts supporting the roof and keeping the walls upright.

Various tarpaulin-covered masses fill the room. 

A trap door is set in the floor. 

Sometimes smugglers and forgers have been known to stash things in here, since the building is close to the docks but rarely attracts the interest of customs officials.

The snapping continues.

>We close the backpack.

Ominous sounds come through the windows, but we're at the wrong angle to see out.

>I don't think there's anything showing that should get us into trouble. Timidly I open the door; the Authenticator has her back to us. We slip out. She makes one more turn in place — monocled gaze sliding across us without stopping — and then she strides away to the north.

It's a quick walk through the marina district. 

Counterfeit Monkey
It takes a minute for us to adjust to the light in here. Built when people were a bit shorter and ceilings were a bit lower, the Counterfeit Monkey is always smoky and never well lit, even in the middle of the day.

...and... Slango is not here.

This is bad. Even I can see this is bad. What happened to your confidence in your team? Where are the guys who are supposed to get us out of here?

Something must have gone wrong.

"Help you?" asks Parker the barman unenthusiastically.

I'd like to ask whether he has seen Slango.

>We open the backpack.

The snapping continues.

We want to ask whether he has seen Slango.

>That was a rhetorical question.

The snapping continues.

We want to ask whether he has seen Slango.

>We make the brief hike through the marina district. 

Outdoor Café
From this slightly raised terrace, tourists have a view of the activity in the market and out over the docks.

Curiously, there's an acquaintance of yours here: Nexami Engeo is at one of the round black metal tables. He's a musician, the front man of engeo. Your gang helped him out with some customs issues because of his unusual name.

Nexami nods to us. "Watch out. That table next to you has something sticky spilled on it." And indeed there is a spill. You were about to lean on it nonchalantly.

The snapping continues.

I'd like to say thanks for pointing out spill or ask what he is doing in Atlantis.

>That's already open.

The snapping continues.

I'd like to say thanks for pointing out spill or ask what he is doing in Atlantis.

From this slightly raised terrace, tourists have a view of the activity in the market and out over the docks. The street is east, the Fish Market north.

Nexami Engeo is at one of the round black metal tables. Someone has left a spill on another.

>We reset the device to p. There is a smell of anise, and the spill turns into a sill. It is a bit useless and disembodied without an accompanying window, but here it is: a board of white painted wood.

"Nice clean-up method," Nexami Engeo comments. "Beats using a rag." At least, I think that's what he said.

The snapping continues.

He stands up and mutters something. I have a little trouble with his Scottish accent — we don't get a lot of that around here, for obvious reasons — but you interpret it as him saying he'd better go pay up.

He heads into the interior of the café.

>We take the sill.

The snapping continues.

>It's a brief walk through the marina district. 

Counterfeit Monkey
Infamously this pub was raided in 1929, the year that the Bureau developed its first meager attempt at an Authentication Scope, and dozens of smugglers and fraudulent businessmen went to jail. But neither that raid nor subsequent scrutiny has ever shut the place down entirely. Built when people were a bit shorter and ceilings were a bit lower, the Counterfeit Monkey is always smoky and never well lit, even in the middle of the day.

The clientele are currently engaged in a game of darts, while the barman watches and practices a sarcastic wit on those who embarrass themselves. There is also a quantity of Origin Paste sitting out on the bar. 

Parker acknowledges our return with a nod.

The snapping continues.

My response would be to ask whether he has seen Slango or ask whether we can have the origin paste.

You are reminded of your crew's attitude to Atlantis law.

>We nod.

The snapping continues.

We could ask whether he has seen Slango or ask whether we can have the origin paste.

>"I wonder whether you've seen an associate of mine," we say to Parker. "Name of Slango."

Parker looks over the bar at us. "He comes in here from time to time," he says. "Very regular customer. Always has about three rum and cokes." 

This is a lie, and therefore a test. Slango doesn't drink alcohol himself and doesn't permit drunkenness in his crew.

The snapping continues.

We want to challenge Parker about the rum.

>"Must be a different Slango," we say. "Mine is more of a root beer man. Thanks anyway though."

"Oh, that Slango," Parker says. "He's been around town the last couple of days, but not today. If you know his lady friend, you might try her." 

Lady friend? This can only mean Lena, she being the only female native with whom Slango spends much time socially. But you wouldn't have guessed that she'd advanced to the status of lady friend. Either way, Lena is a rather odd woman who keeps a used bookstore off Deep Street.

The snapping continues.

We could ask whether we can have the origin paste.

>"That Origin Paste for sale?" 

"Well now," he says, grinning, "that would surely be illegal, would it not? Origin Paste is after all a controlled substance in this country, due to its unhappy association with fraudulent activities. On the other hand there is no law against someone winning the Origin Paste in a completely legitimate game of chance or skill."

The snapping continues.

We could ask how one might go about winning.

>"Explain this game as though I have no idea what you're talking about," you say, leaning on the bar in an interested fashion. Are you flirting with Parker? No? Okay. Good to know.

"It's a designated challenge game," says Parker. You've seen this played before, but he explains the rules anyway. 

"There are two contestants, one challenger and one defender.

"The challenger chooses any object he likes and shows it to the moderator ahead of time.

"The defender, without seeing the object, stipulates a general category. The challenger has five minutes to turn his designated object into an item that fits the defender's category, or he forfeits his ante."

The snapping continues.

We could play the game.

You have a fleeting thought of past experience playing games.

>"I'd like to play that," we say.

"Excellent. Oh, I did mention the small matter of the entry fee?"

I get out the roll of bills and he peels off two twenties.

"Thank you. Now, you pick your entry article, and I'll ask one of these good gentlemen to suggest a defense category."

The snapping continues.

>"Right," says the barman. "The sill it is." 

He turns towards the group assembled around the dartboard. "Anyone want to defend against this character?" (with a nod at you). 

"Something smaller than a pebble!" suggests a woman in the front row. She passes forward her own ante to the bar, and the game is on.

The snapping continues.

>We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the sill. With an audible SPLORT, the sill becomes a spill. 

The spill drips out of our hands.

The snapping continues.

>We reset the device to s. There is a mauve cloud, and the spill turns into a pill. It is small, round, and blue. There are no brand or generic markings to indicate what it might do.

"A winner!" says the barman, straightening up. "What do you know? The Origin Paste is all yours, darling."

This produces a squawk of surprise and irritation from the defendant, and you get the impression that this game has been agreeably fleecing tourists all day. Pity you had to come along and spoil it.

The snapping continues.

We could ask whether he has any other games going.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now twenty-nine.]

>"What do you think of this?" we ask, pointing to the pill.

This evokes no particular interest.

The snapping continues.

I'm inclined to ask whether he has any other games going.

>We dip out a fingertip-coating quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the pill. With an audible SPLORT, the pill becomes a spill.

>We get the sill.

The snapping continues.

I'm inclined to ask whether he has any other games going.

>We take the Origin Paste. A cake of pale purple: it is able to disguise letter-reformed objects so that they don't look like obvious frauds, or even show up under authentication.

The only problem with it is the distinctive smell.

The snapping continues.

I'd like to ask whether he has any other games going.

>We walk through the marina district. 

Tin Hut
Most of the light in here comes from circular windows punched into the tin walls just under the ceiling. From the inside, the building looks both larger and more sound than it appears from outside: there are plenty of sturdy struts supporting the roof and keeping the walls upright.

Various tarpaulin-covered masses fill the room. 

A trap door is set in the floor. 

The snapping continues.

>We prop the trap door open with the sill.

The snapping continues.

Crawlspace
An awkward, low, concrete-lined crawlspace beneath the tin hut. It smells somewhat like animals; in spite of this it clearly gets a bit more use than anyone would like the customs officials to know about.

The trap door, wedged open by a sill, admits the only light.

The only significant thing down here is a crate. 

The snapping continues.

>We open the crate, revealing a watch, a band, and a single discarded leaflet.

The snapping continues.

>watch: We get the watch.
band: We acquire the band.
leaflet: We take the leaflet.

The snapping continues.

>We reset the device to r. There is a distinct spearmint flavor, and the crate turns into a cate. Rarely found in the singular, a cate is something delicious: it comes from the same roots as "caterer". At any rate, this lovely little confection, with its layers of shiny-smooth chocolate and sliced strawberry and rum-soaked cake, its chocolate-shaving frills and piped cream, could have come from the best Paris confiserie.

The snapping continues.

>We pick up the cate.

Aquarium Bookstore
The shop takes its name from the collection of fish mounted on every wall: swordfish, bass, other things I don't recognize. Underneath these dubious tokens, the walls are covered with bookshelves, and there are stacks of books on the floor where the shelves have proven insufficient.

The merchandise consists mainly, but not exclusively, of books, and the selection caters to odd tastes. You once picked up in here a book about a man who R-removed a wrench, and then had his way with it. You and Brock had a good time with that one for the next month and a half.

Lena is present, all right. In fact she watches us keenly the instant we come into the shop. Lena is an associate of Slango's. You hadn't realized that had crossed over into a romance. Slango has never, ever in your recollection dated anyone. And now this.

"Happy Serial Comma Day," she says.

"Glad to see you've got plenty of origin paste," Lena remarks. "It's such a useful thing to have. Smells so nice."

The snapping continues.

I'm inclined to ask whether she has seen Slango or say who we are.

>"You wouldn't happen to have seen Slango about recently?" we ask.

"Slango?" she asks blankly, for all the world as though she'd had a lobotomy. "Is that a board game?"

The snapping continues.

We want to say who we are.

>"Lena, it's Andra. And company. Maybe Slango mentioned that I was auditioning a new silent partner."

"I don't know what you're talking about," she says. "But since you're here, whoever you are, I wonder whether you'd like to have a look at some merchandise of mine that could use a spruce." 

Aha. She wants us to prove our identity; probably has contraband that needs concealing, and wants us to do the deed as proof of trustworthiness.

There's a brief pause.

Lena goes off into a corner and rummages among the suspicious piles of books, and uncovers a box. "C'mere," she says; and obediently I wander over to that area of the store, which incidentally happens to be tucked away and half-hidden by shelves.

"See here," she says. "See what you can do with it, eh?"

The snapping continues.

>It's just a cardboard box in which some items of interest have been stored.

In the contraband box are some modems and some preamps.

Lena apparently wants our help getting them into a less identifiable format.

>We reset the device to m. With a distinct whiff of old book, the modems turn into some odes. A slender volume of poetry, bound between red covers. It looks completely harmless and is written in English.

The blurb on the back describes it as a "collection of meditations" on Atlantis' imaginary roots, which is to say, a lot of stuff about magic-wielding Phoenicians, Knights Templar, refugees from the Tower of Babel, space aliens, cabalistic mysticism, and Lully's combinatorics.

It fits in perfectly with the rest of Lena's selection. Really amazing work. I've seen other people who were able to do impressive things with local field distortions — think hard enough and you can prejudice the outcome of a linguistic transition.

But this... this is detail work like I haven't seen. My hat is off.

Or would be if I were wearing a hat and taking it off didn't mean making you take it off too.

Lena touches the binding appreciatively. "You've even got that little bit of creasing in the spine that makes it look used," she says. "This is perfect. Only risk is customers wanting to buy it. I've got a couple this would be right up their alley."

The snapping continues.

>We reset the device to s. With a distinct whiff of paper, the odes turn into an ode. A short poem, letter-pressed attractively on a sheet of thick paper. It is entitled "Our Ancestors, The Immortal Spirits of the Pyramids," a fact which disinclines me to study the rest.

"Well, it's portable, and it doesn't look like much, but then again, it doesn't look like much. I mean, I could easily lose it, couldn't I? Just one sheet. And if someone were to ask me why I was carrying it around that would be a little hard to explain. It's not like it's a whole book of 'em, is it?"

The snapping continues.

I'd like to calm Lena.

>We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the ode. With an audible SPLORT, the ode becomes some modems. 

"Let's go back to the odes," Lena suggests.

The snapping continues.

>We reset the device to m. The modems give way to the now-familiar odes.

"I'm looking forward to what you do with the preamps," Lena says. "They should look... innocent."

The snapping continues.

>We reset the device to s. There is a flash of yellow light, and the preamps turn into a preamp. It looks like just one specimen from the group from which you were working.

"I was hoping you'd make the preamp look less like electronics," she offers, evidently forgetting the fake off-handedness with which she started this transaction.

The snapping continues.

I'd like to calm Lena.

>We reset the device to p. There is a smell of anise, and the preamp turns into a ream. One ream, which is to say 500 sheets, of generic printer or copier paper, in white-white.

"That works. Kind of thing I might have around for printing invoices on. I was a little afraid there you were going to go for a ram just to spite me. Don't know where I'd put one of those around here."

The snapping continues.

>We smear some of the Origin Paste onto the ream. Nothing obvious happens, of course, but that is the whole point.

"Nice monocle, by the way! You do have all the good toys. Suppose it means you can check your work and see whether you've really got enough paste on things."

The snapping continues.

>We smear some of the Origin Paste onto the odes. Nothing obvious happens, of course, but that is the whole point.

"Perfect," Lena says, regarding her contraband possessions with satisfaction. "Welcome back, Andra and Guest."

The snapping continues.

I'd like to ask whether she has seen Slango.

>"Now, you owe me one Slango," you say. "Where'd he get to?"

"Slango and I were catching up. Bless that man, he's hung like a yak," she says. "But he got bad news and had to hurry back to the yacht. Said something about not being able to keep an appointment. I take it you're the appointment? I can try reaching him for you, if you want."

The snapping continues.

I'd like to encourage Lena to contact Slango.

>"That would be extremely helpful," we say. Perhaps we can finally get off this island and back into our separate skins, which would not be one minute too soon for me.

"Very good," she says. She goes over to one of the free-standing shelves and takes out copies of Indian Summer and Seventy Ways to Disable an Authentication Scope. Behind these works of literature she finds what looks like a cellular phone; but it mustn't be one, or at least not of the usual variety, because the Bureau tightly controls such items. 

We hear half a conversation. "It's me. There's someone to see... yes, I had her do the contraband... I don't know, a little taller and a lot less mean... Oh! I see. She looks healthy enough... I'm not running a restaurant! Okay. Okay. I'll talk to you later, sweetie. Bye." 

Without meeting our eye, she buries the phone back in its previous location. Then she says, "He's coming in direct. He says go over to Counterfeit Monkey and he'll be right over as originally planned, and he's sorry about the wait."

"Oh! And." She tosses us a coin. "Have a drink on me."

The snapping continues.

We want to thank Lena.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now thirty-two.]

>We dip out a fingertip-coating quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the as. With an audible SPLORT, the as becomes a pastis. An anise-flavored liqueur. It's an acquired taste, but now that I've acquired it, I like to exercise the acquisition as frequently as possible. You may not be as big a fan, for which I apologize in advance.

The snapping continues.

We could thank Lena.

>"This would be a good time to stop for lunch and a little siesta," says Lena, following us to the door. As we go out, she's rolling down the shades and putting up a closed sign.

We walk through the marina district. 

Counterfeit Monkey
Built when people were a bit shorter and ceilings were a bit lower, the Counterfeit Monkey is always smoky and never well lit, even in the middle of the day.

Slango sits at a dark table, nursing a root beer. Slango is, of course, not Slango's real name. He is half criminal, half ideological revolutionary: uncouth, restless, always hungry for a new exploit. Had he been born into a freer society, he might have become a very valuable engineer or consultant. He has been your mentor in crime and your usher into the world of adults.

Slango meets our eye for a long minute without smiling.

The snapping continues.

We could say who we are.

>He's dressed plainly but neatly: clean jeans, crisp white button-up shirt. His face is calm and his voice is even and he could be any age between thirty and fifty. He looked that way when you met him eight years ago, too.

>"Slango," you say. "Lena gave me a totally unwanted visual about your yaklike proportions. Guess you also got a yak's sense of clock time?"

"It was an emergency. I figured you'd go to Lena, and I was right."

"You were lucky. I knew her a little, but I had no idea you two were making the yak with two humps."

"No such thing as a bactrian yak," Slango replies. "My apologies. I assumed that what Brock knows, he passes on to you, and he certainly knows about me and Lena." He scowls into his root beer. "Nearly gave himself a hernia laughing," Slango adds under his breath.

The snapping continues.

I'm inclined to explain Brock's probable reasons or ask whether we can leave now.

>"She's old enough to be your spinster aunt and flaky enough to tell your fortune with half a tarot deck and a couple of Uno cards," you say. "We haven't got a lot of clues about what your type is, but I doubt Brock would have guessed Lena."

"She's thirty-two," says Slango crisply. "She runs Radio Free Atlantida single-handed with electronics she built herself. And if she were old enough to be my spinster aunt, that would still be my business."

"So, uh, I guess you guys are pretty serious, then," you say.

"I'd give her and me better odds than you and Brock."

The snapping continues.

We could mutter darkly or ask whether we can leave now.

>We wait for Slango to go on.

"Brock's run into a little trouble pursuing a profitable opportunity."

The snapping continues.

I'm inclined to ask what the trouble was.

>"Define trouble."

"I had a pick-up arranged to get him off the island shore all the way down by Maiana last night, but he didn't make it, and sent no messages. I checked a contact in Bureau Processing, but no arrest file has gone through, so Brock hasn't been caught. He's just... missing."

Raised voices near the bar interrupt you for a moment.  "We can't leave without Brock," Slango says, as though you needed persuading.

Or maybe he's saying that to the me half of us. Right now, it's true that I'm not keen on the prospect of hanging out in Atlantis. We're already way behind the plan.

The snapping continues.

I'd like to complain about the inefficiency of this scheme.

You are reminded of how it started with Brock.

>Sorry, but I have to get this out there. "I was really expecting a smoother escape plan when I arranged to work with your operation," I say.

Slango eyes us with disfavor. "Andra, you got a moron up in your head. Kid — Alex — we aren't travel agents."

Over the voices of the crowd comes the sound of the barman setting out another round.  "I've got to get back to the yacht; it's empty," Slango says. "And I would prefer not to let the Bureau get a good look at me, while your current face is, shall we say, disposable. The trick is, we don't know where Brock is. If he left a message for us, it'll be at the dead drop."

That's a spot at the public convenience by the town bus station where the three of you leave messages for one another when necessary. Usually quiet, yet anonymous. "We're on it," we say.

"Glad to hear it," says Slango. "Now stop referring to yourself as 'we' in company."

The snapping continues.

This gives us something to go on, anyway. We give Slango what I intend as a reassuring nod of solidarity.

"Back to the yacht for me," Slango says. "Don't let the other half of your head do anything you wouldn't do."

"Which of us are you talking to?" I ask smartly.

"Both."

He heads out towards the docks and quickly disappears from view — returning to the yacht to wait for us to arrive with Brock.

Docks
Here are some dozens of boats tied up: some of them are small to medium-sized fishing craft, some tourist boats for trips around the island, some merely ferries to the deeper harbor where the cruise ships anchor.

To the east, up a moderate rise from the sea-level docks, is the imposing exterior of the Customs House. The classical look is only a little undermined by the public-service posters along the front. There passports are inspected and cargo passed under authentication, foreign items renamed or confiscated, and suspected smugglers interrogated.

Immediately west, the Counterfeit Monkey's sign sways in the wind. 

The snapping continues.

>It's a brief drive through the marina district as far as the Roundabout. 

The whole Roundabout has ground to a halt, with protesters walking in the street and in some places completely filling the road. But this is mostly a nuisance until I notice that there are a couple of teenagers handcuffed to a tree.

I give the wheel a yank and run the car up onto the central traffic circle a little way. Call it a parking job. We need to get those kids out of here before their arrest is processed and they go to storage. I might not have the nerve to do anything by myself, but you're with me, and I'm starting to appreciate that's like being Batman.


Traffic Circle (jammed into the car)
Normally no pedestrian ever comes to this circle of grass and litter: the flow of traffic is too constant and too fast. But the protest has stopped the traffic and I'm determined to do something about the two teenagers I saw just now, so here we are. Though we probably have to get out of the car if we're going to be useful.

A giant Atlantida statue stands at the center, decorated in an unorthodox fashion with a sign and a stuffed octopus. Atlantida is to us a bit as Uncle Sam might be to you, except that she embodies the spirit of the people rather than the government. In recent years she's become a symbol of opposition to the Bureau.

Two teenagers are cuffed to a brown tree, apparently for safe-keeping while the All-Purpose Officer undoes their vandalism. He has a diminutive affixer. 

The snapping continues.

>I can see an officer making his way between the cars and stopping at the fake ones. Maybe we'd better conceal our car before we leave it — we may need to make a quick getaway later.

The snapping continues.

The snapping continues.

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now thirty-eight.]

>We open the car door: perhaps unsurprisingly, it comes without an effective lock system.

We switch the ignition off.

We climb out of the car.

"Go ahead, put us in Cold Storage!" shouts the defiant teenager. "I'm happy to sleep through all this shit and wake up when we have jet packs and a government that respects the rights of its people."

The All-Purpose Officer shifts the restoration gel rifle from one hand to another; looks around; and then props it against the foot of the statue.

The snapping continues.

>Time passes.

The nervous teenager looks unhappy. "We won't get out of here until our families are all dead and global warming has reduced Atlantis to three square feet of hilltop."

The All-Purpose Officer goes around to the back of the statue and begins to climb up the leg, finding footholds in the folds of Atlantida's gown. It looks like a precarious business, but he's determined.

The snapping continues.

>We pick up the rifle. It fits well in your hand: good heft. I feel like we know how to aim this thing. It's illegal to carry, but that doesn't seem to be bothering you right now.

The nervous teenager struggles against her bonds.

Gritting his teeth, the All-Purpose Officer climbs for access out onto Atlantida's huge metal arm. It looks about as sturdy as a substantial tree branch, but more slippery, and inconveniently angled.

The snapping continues.

>(with the restoration gel rifle)
We shoot the restoration gel rifle at the brown tree. With an audible SPLORT, the brown tree becomes a brown tee. It's a brown wooden peg for putting a golf ball on. Apparently the All-Purpose Officer performed a little light R-insertion when he found himself in need of a portable tree.

Freed from attachment to the tree, the teenagers look at each other and then run off into the crowd.

The All-Purpose Officer glances around, but you've made us stand so our body conceals the rifle from his angle. He growls in annoyance. "Station," he says, apparently to thin air. "I need back-up."

Understood, says a tinny distant voice.

Once the All-Purpose Officer comes level with the sign, he shoots it with the diminutive affixer, turning it into a signet. It's an outsized signet bearing the crest of the Bureau of Orthography, now hanging around the statue's neck in the same way that the sign did a moment ago.

The snapping continues.

>We prop the rifle back at the foot of the statue.

The crowd is parting. We might be able to leave soon.

Laboriously and with obvious irritation, the All-Purpose Officer pries the arms of the stuffed octopus off the statue's wrist, where they appear to have been fixed with glue.

The snapping continues.

>We get into the car.

We climb back in the car, and no one seems to be much the wiser about what just happened. I have to say, you know what you're doing. Traffic is starting to move again. We'd better get on to the dead drop.

Roundabout (jammed into the car)
We are jammed into the car with our knees almost at our chin, looking out through the bulbous little windshield.

The traffic flows in a tight circle around a statue which we know all too well.

Confusing signs point in various directions: northeast to Deep Street, northwest to High Street, south to Long Street, east to Tall Street.

The snapping continues.

>At Long Street South we pull easily into one of the available parking spots, since many people have now gone home.

My apartment is that direction, but unless we have some reason to go there, it seems least suspicious to avoid my old neighborhood.


Long Street South
Long Street is lined on each side with a double-row of tall, anemic palm trees that bend towards one another many feet overhead. We are now in the southern part of this long corridor, between the Canadian Embassy and Arbot Maps & Antiques.

Someone has left a shopping bag at the roadside — maybe by accident when loading up a car, maybe because they mean to come back for it. There are a ball and a jigsaw in the shopping bag. 

Our car — which might better be described as a covered bicycle — is parked nearby. 

We can go north, south, and west from here.

The snapping continues.

>We drive over to Tall Street. There we pull easily into one of the available parking spots, since many people have now gone home.

Then it's a quick hike. 

Public Convenience
There are just the two toilet stalls and a couple of sinks, but the place has been kept up reasonably well, if one doesn't count the graffiti.

A soap dispenser hangs beside the mirror. 

About knee-height in one of the stalls is a hole that runs right through the wall between the men's and women's restrooms. It's here that you and Brock and Slango usually leave things for one another.

A faint smell of lavender lingers in the air.

The snapping continues.

>We reset the device to s. There is a flash of canary light, and the sink turns into some ink. It's a blue-black ink derived from squid or cuttlefish, in a small bottle.

The snapping continues.

>We pick up the ink.

The snapping continues.

>It's too small to get a good look through, really, and usually cluttered with junk.

In the hole in the wall is some ash.

>At first there doesn't seem to be anything in there, but when we put our finger in, we find it's full of ash.

The snapping continues.

>(first taking the monocle)
The monocle fails to make any sound or response at all, but no green image forms revealing the true nature of the ash.

The snapping continues.

>Lavender wafts back at us.

The snapping continues.

>We just touch a coated fingertip of gel to the ash. With an audible SPLORT, the ash becomes some trash. Most of it's junk: sweet wrappers, tissues, bus tickets. But there's also, suggestively, an appointment card for Arbot Maps & Antiques.

The snapping continues.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now forty-one.]

>We take the trash.

The snapping continues.

>We have a short walk. 

Rotunda
Echoing space, marble floor, eye-like skylight many meters above us: so far, the Rotunda might belong to any 19th-century government bureau of means and self-importance.

What sets this one apart is the lettering, each sigil no bigger than a flea, carved over every inch of the walls. Inscribed here is, in fact, the entire text of A New Orthodox Orthography, which means that if we had a great deal of patience and many rolls of butcher paper, we could take rubbings and wind up with our very own volume.

We don't, of course. There are better things to do. More important places to go. The administrative part of the bureau is away to the south, and there is an exhibit of letter tools to the east, which is open to the public.

Near the street entrance is a sizable informational bulletin-board advertising the services of the Bureau; and next to this, pushed back to be out of the way, is a bin. The bin contains a shuttle. 

The snapping continues.

>We take the bin. BUREAU PARKING, reads the bin, in thick black marker. DO NOT TAKE UNLESS AUTHORIZED.

The snapping continues.

>At Long Street South we pull easily into one of the available parking spots, since many people have now gone home.

We show the appointment card, and are let in.

Arbot Maps & Antiques
There is a large collection of vintage and antique maps under glass — the island of Atlantis as a whole, street maps of here and of Maiana, navigation maps of the harbor, and then maps of more distant places as well. 

A stylish mannequin near the front sports a pair of Britishizing goggles. 

Overseeing all this is a woman named Kate. 

"Welcome to Arbot," says Kate. "Feel free to browse and ask me any questions you may have about the merchandise."

The snapping continues.

I'd like to ask whether she has seen Brock.

>We study the maps. One in the collection stands out: a map of Slangovia, framed like all the others but of suspiciously recent vintage.

>Kate is watching us; I think we'd best buy anything we need here, rather than trying to filch it.

The snapping continues.

We could ask whether she has seen Brock.

>(from Kate)
"I'll have this map of Slangovia," we say.

"That just came in today," Kate says. "We bought it from a visiting scholar — he'd come to attend a demonstration with my boss, as a matter of fact, and happened to have this item with him."

She looks at the map dubiously for a moment. "Just between us, I've never heard of Slangovia. But as the seller was a guest of my employer, it seemed rude to quibble. And it is a very attractively drawn piece. I'm sure you'll enjoy it."

Kate removes the map from its case and packs it up carefully for us.

The snapping continues.

I'd like to ask whether she has seen Brock.

>We make the drive to Long Street North. There we pull easily into one of the available parking spots, since many people have now gone home.

Then it's a quick hike. 

Fleur d'Or Drinks Club
The back wall is dramatically decorated with bottled liquors of all sorts, from gin to cachaça; there's a giant bottle of Campari, taller than your average three-year-old, with a red ribbon around its neck.

What makes this place technically a drinks club rather than a bar is its license to serve letter-manufactured food and drink. A toolkit on the bar contains some screwdrivers, some gimlets, and some rusty nails, ready to be transformed into their respective cocktails.

When the bartender isn't looking his way, the patron makes some notes on a PDA, then puts it away again. 

She acknowledges us with a nod as we stroll up to the bar and get close enough to hear their conversation. "It was originally produced as a toy, but it's actually a bit dangerous," the bartender is saying.

"Dangerous? How so?" asks the patron.

"Various ways," she says. "Suppose I hit a small object that has a big homonym, like say a plane. You know, the carpentry kind. Suddenly I've got an airplane-style plane on top of me."

The snapping continues.

>"What do you make of this?" we ask, showing off the legend.

"This?" she says, looking a little surprised. "You want it converted?"

"Why not?"

"No reason," she says. "Just I did the same item a few hours ago for a gentleman. Really hot, with these amazing eyes-"

"Whatever," you say, before she can get any more excited about Brock.

She smirks. Then she taps the legend with her paddle and it transforms into a proper map legend.

"What if you hit something that doesn't mean anything else?" the patron asks. "Like a chicken?"

"Nothing," she says. "That's safe." As though to demonstrate, she smacks the paddle against her left buttock. "See? I don't get changed into a different bartender. Want to try?"

She holds up the paddle as though she's going to tap him with it.

"Uh... my name is Mark," he says.

"Maybe not, then!" she says, laughing brightly.

The snapping continues.

[Your score has gone up by one point and is now forty-two.]

>This legend has been edited from its original form, replacing the words like HOSPITAL and RESTROOM with other, hand-written labels: INVITE, GOT, 11, OUT, T-INSERTER, etc. By arranging the words of the legend in the order in which the icons appear along the main street, we arrive at GOT INVITE T-INSERTER DEMONSTRATION. OUT 11 AM.

Of course, it's already long past 11 AM, so Brock's plan clearly went wrong. If we're going to go after him, we'll have to go to the T-inserter demonstration ourselves. The catch is that, as dangerous new technology, it's held inside the Bureau and requires a special invitation to enter.

I think I know where we can get one, though. My advisor Professor Waterstone — that's the person overseeing my graduate research — was also invited to this demonstration. We might be able to get his.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now forty-five.]

>Once we get to Long Street South we pull easily into one of the available parking spots, since many people have now gone home.

Palm Square
Now this is my part of town: Palm Square is the beginning of the university district. To the southeast, through the iron gate, is the university campus proper; and that unobtrusive little doorway directly south of us leads into the Babel Café.

I live in the apartment complex that runs along the west side of the square — in fact, my apartment door is immediately to the southwest. 

The snapping continues.

>That way lies the bathroom window of my apartment. Though in fact, if you have a mind to break in, it's the easiest way: it's not hard to force the window.

The snapping continues.

>The window slides open with a hideous protesting shriek.

"Halt! You! Young person!"

It's my neighbor, Mrs. Parsnip, leaning out from her apartment above us. Mrs. Parsnip and I don't interact except about once a month when she comes around to ask for my spare change for bus fare or the laundry.

"Clear off or I'll call the police!" she shouts.

>
...No, don't worry, I'll handle this.

I step us back and stare up at her. "I'm a friend of Alex," I say. "He called and asked me to stop by because he thought he left the stove on. Said he climbs in the window all the time when he gets locked out."

"That's true," she says. "Shouldn't be allowed out by himself. Okay, go ahead."

In a mutter she adds, "Not like he has anything worth stealing anyway." She vanishes from view.

The window is uncomfortably high and it takes a little scramble to get in, but soon we are inside. 

Apartment Bathroom
An antique nightstand of my mother's, which does not actually fit anywhere near my bed, is jammed into one corner of the bathroom. On the nightstand are a key and a ring. 

The bathroom window gives some weak sunlight. 

We could climb back out the window, or we could go south into the rest of my apartment.

The snapping continues.

>
My Apartment
I should point out my copy of The Problem of Adjectives. I should have taken it back to the library — I meant to take it back to the library — but there just wasn't time. The last couple of hours before I came to meet you were frantic. The way I figured it, my parents or someone will come looking for me and they'll take it back for me. I think.

I'd apologize for the mess, but should we really be here? I'm reconciled to leaving all my things behind, you know. You made me promise that I didn't mind.

The snapping continues.

>We take The Problem of Adjectives. Might as well return it to the department seminar room, as long as we're going that way.

The snapping continues.

>We're about to, when the door to the street opens and my mother walks into the room. She shuts it behind her and puts away her key before she notices us. Then she stands very still. For about a quarter second she considers calling the police, but I can see that worry passing away again as she takes in our clothing, age, and general demeanor.

"Hi there," she says, coming forward to take our hand. "I'm Mrs. Rosehip. Alex Rosehip's mother. You must be a friend of his?"

The snapping continues.

We could say we're his girlfriend.

>"Yes — sort of. We've been... I mean, we've been on a few dates." That's you, and I have to say you don't sound as keen on dating ourself as you might.

She raises her eyebrows. "I see. How secretive of him not to bring you around. And where is Alex now? I need to speak with him. He's been hard to reach lately."

I know you think it's a bit sketchy that my mother just walks into my apartment when I'm not around, but I swear to you she's never done that before. She must be more worried about something than she's letting on.

The snapping continues.

We could claim to have seen him this morning or say we don't know.

>"He went out to, ah, do some research, I think. He left before I was completely awake." (Thanks, now you've given my mother the impression that I'm a cad.)

She looks at the dissheveled futon, and her expression becomes even more unreadable. "I did think I'd taught my son better manners," she remarks. "I apologize on his behalf."

Mother picks her way to the refrigerator, which she opens, revealing only some yogurt. "Evidently not planning to have dinner at home this evening," she comments.

The snapping continues.

We could explain we might go out.

>She gives the refrigerator door a little push and it swings closed.

"How well do you know him?" Mother asks. She immediately catches herself, and adds: "I'm not inquiring into the details of your relationship. But I am concerned about him. He has seemed very unhappy recently about his work. Has he said anything to you about that? Wanting to leave the program, or change careers, or... anything?" 

I didn't think she'd noticed.

The snapping continues.

We could reassure Mother or suggest the truth.

>"I think it's graduate school getting to him a bit," we lie. I am pretty sure this is what my mother thinks: she has little time for whining or sulking, and I believe she considers any ideological queasiness I may have exhibited to be just malingering about research that is not going well.

"Really?" she says. "Hm." 

I would like her to go on, but she doesn't: because it would be indiscreet, because she doesn't trust us.

Mother appears to be meditating about the kitchen area.

"Well," Mother says. "I had better go. If you do see Alex, tell him to call me, please. It isn't an emergency, but you can tell him there's a bit of Bureau business I'd like to discuss with him."

The snapping continues.

We nod, and suddenly it is borne in on me that this may be the last I see of my mother in a lifetime: and I'm trying to memorize the exact cut of her hair and the way her expensive Italian heels tap on the floor, and meanwhile she is going out completely indifferent to the moment. I could have stood for our previous meeting to be the last one — we had dinner and she hugged me goodbye then. This makes it all much much worse.

And you, you're nattering at me in our head, asking what she meant about the Bureau. It might be, I guess, that they've been watching me and that she got wind of it. That would be likely. But if so it doesn't matter, not any more.

She's not even visible through the window any longer.

>We get the key. It's made of an extremely ordinary blank.

The snapping continues.

>We get the ring. A gold-toned ring that from a distance would look like a signet. In fact the face of it is figured with the symbol of the university, an owl biting the letter A in its beak. Embedded in this face is the tiny RFID tag that opens generic university security.

It is the perfect combination of technical paranoia and old-fashioned pretentiousness, and one is assigned to every new student with great pomp on the day of orientation.

The snapping continues.

My Apartment
It's an efficiency: note the kitchen area, with all the usual appliances, in one corner. My mother attempted to provide a microwave, rice cooker, toaster, waffle iron, and julienne-fry-maker, but I pointed out that these objects would triple-populate the two square feet of available counter space.

My futon is on the floor in the opposite corner.  

On the counter are Journal of Third-World Economics and Studies in Primary Language Acquisition. 

The snapping continues.

>We unlock the apartment door.

We open the apartment door.

Palm Square
Palm Square is the beginning of the university district. To the southeast, through the iron gate, is the university campus proper; and that unobtrusive little doorway directly south of us leads into the Babel Café.

I live in the apartment complex that runs along the west side of the square — in fact, my apartment door is immediately to the southwest. 

My bathroom window remains vulnerably open.  

The snapping continues.

>Babel Café
Through many changes of management, this institution has fed the denizens of the university and ignored their semi-sedition.

A clerk in a white apron stands behind the long glass case. There are a pocket-bread, a wrap, and a honey pastry triangle in the long glass case. 

The tables are square wooden things painted dark blue (not the vibrant blue of the Bureau, but something closer to midnight), and the upper surfaces are découpaged with antique travel postcards. 

A blue plaque is mounted on the wall. 

The clerk grins at us in a welcoming way.

The snapping continues.

>University Oval
This is the center of the university, a broad grassy oval shaded with sycamore trees and surrounded by buildings in brick or white stone.

An activist is standing in our way, gripping a sign that says "TOXI WASTE AWARENESS!". 

Immediately south of here is the building where I spend most of my time, Samuel Johnson Hall. 

"Do you have a minute to help save the environment?" the activist asks brightly.

The snapping continues.

I'd like to say no or say yes.

>"I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry," we say. 

Evidently she has a greater than usual flair for drama, because she refuses to be brushed off that easily. "You're in a hurry now," she says, "but in a few short decades, you'll be much too late. Please, for the good of your planet."

She sets down the sign in order to free her hands for more expressive argument. "Listen, we're trying to gain financial support to make a major advertising campaign pushing the concept of toxi waste throughout the anglophone world. If you know anything about linguistic efficacy, I'm sure you can imagine the implications." 

I can, in fact, imagine the implications, probably a little better than she would like.

The snapping continues.

We could encourage the activist to elaborate on the implications.

>"Oh?" we say neutrally. This is all it takes.

"Toxi waste would be, in concept, a completely harmless, safe, and neutral substance that would have no detrimental impact on the surrounding environment. By raising awareness of toxi waste throughout the Anglophone world, we would put the collective consciousness to work for the environment! It would then be possible for volunteer workers to convert large stocks of dangerous toxic waste into the safe, neutral toxi waste using minimal energy."

The snapping continues.

We want to ask how consciousness will be raised or ask how the campaign will address problems of visualization.

>"And, er, how do you plan to raise awareness of toxi waste to sufficient levels to achieve linguistic efficacy?" we ask. Well, that was mostly me. But I'm curious.

"That's where people like you come in," she admits, with a sweet little smile.

She touches our arm. "The next few months are critical to our operation," the activist says. "We need to be able to blitz multiple countries simultaneously with an intense and outrageous advertising campaign that will garner further media coverage from news sources and provoke discussion on the internet and in the workplace. But in order to do that, we need the funding to place high profile advertisements in a variety of places. That's why donations from people like yourself are going to be so very necessary."

The snapping continues.

We could donate.

>The activist seems to have given up on convincing us and lets us go by in peace.

Samuel Johnson Hall
This is the main building for Language Studies. This is not to be confused with Language Engineering, which is the department that handles devices for the manipulation of language-objects; it is also not to be confused with Linguistics, English Literature, or Comparative Literature, all of which have their own buildings and faculties. Language Studies applies itself to questions of linguistic efficacy chiefly at a social and anthropological level.

That's to say that we study how the ability to change things based on their names affects daily life and society.

The department office, with several professorial offices leading off of it, is to the southeast. To the southwest is the seminar room, where many of the upper-level courses occur, and which also contains the department library; downstairs is the basement, where the graduate students and junior instructors are kept.

On the wall hangs a framed photograph of Professor Waterstone, with the words SHAPLY CHAIR in big letters underneath. 

The snapping continues.

Language Studies Department Office
This big, slightly drab area holds such useful objects as the mailboxes and secretary's computer. On ordinary days the secretary would be in as well, presiding over affairs. The offices of individual professors lie north and west.

The printer also sits on the u-shaped desk. 

This corner office was won in a battle of wills with several other departments during the most recent rebuilding drive. Professor Waterstone is fond of reminding the others that he was the one to obtain this favorable position whenever there is a disagreement about procedure.

The snapping continues.

>
Waterstone's Office
A very finicky, neatly arranged room, in which one never feels quite at home.

Professor Waterstone is sitting here. Waterstone is my dissertation advisor. (He insists on the "o" spelling.) He's an expert in the history of linguistic and orthographical power, but he's politically kind of reactionary. "Don't meddle" is pretty much his motto.

We can see an invitation on a desk. It's from Dental Consonants Limited. Their design of stationery is unmistakable.

In front of Professor Waterstone is a small laptop. 

He looks up at us gravely. "I don't believe we've met," he says. "Can I help you?"

The snapping continues.

We could make up some excuse, ask whether he met the activists, or ask why he is working on Serial Comma Day.

>"Why are you in today?" we ask. "Isn't it a holiday?"

"The pursuit of knowledge does not occur according to the calendar," he says. Then he adds, "And my wife is having the carpets shampooed and kicked me out of the house."

The snapping continues.

I'd like to ask whether he met the activists.

>"Did you run into those activists outside?"

"Sadly, it is our misfortune constantly to encounter people with no concept of what language manipulation can and cannot do," Waterstone says. He really seems to be in a bad mood today, even for him: maybe a fight with the wife, or a nasty letter from the dean.

There's a brief pause. "Look, I really must work on this," says Waterstone, chasing us to the door. "Perhaps someone else in the department can answer a few of your questions. I believe I saw Professor Higgate earlier, and Professor Brown is usually in his lab downstairs. I'm sure he's not working on anything too urgent. Goodbye!"

Language Studies Department Office
This big, slightly drab area holds such useful objects as the mailboxes and secretary's computer. On ordinary days the secretary would be in as well, presiding over affairs. The offices of individual professors lie north and west.

The printer also sits on the u-shaped desk. 

The office door closes with measured firmness behind us.

Through the window in Waterstone's door, we can see him turning the lock. When he catches us watching he gives a tight, unfriendly smile and goes back to his desk.

A moment later the printer whirs thoughtfully.

The snapping continues.

>The networked printer handles output for all the computers in the department. The indicator lights glow red to indicate that the paper-drawer is empty. An additional light indicates that some document is in the queue to print and is waiting for the printer to be ready.

The printer is currently switched on.

The paper drawer is closed.

There is nothing on the output tray.

>We pull up on the little catch and draw the drawer out. It's empty.

The snapping continues.

>We have a short walk. 

Graduate Student Office
A small windowless room divided into cubicles for individual graduate students.

A tiny refrigerator stores lunches (sometimes) and looted leftovers from department receptions (when available). On top of the fridge there is a coffee-maker.

My cubicle is the one with the swivel-chair, towards the back of the room by the water cooler. I cleared everything subversive out of there ages ago, and now I do most of my work at home in the apartment. It's safer that way.

We can see a sticky on the swivel-chair. I half recognize the handwriting, but I'm having trouble placing it. One of the other grad students, but I'm not sure which.

The snapping continues.

>We take the sticky. Please be careful. The blue hats are watching you.

The snapping continues.

>We reset the device to y. With a distinct whiff of sap, the sticky turns into a stick. It is about two feet long. It's stripped of its leaves and fairly sturdy.

The snapping continues.

>We open the tiny refrigerator, revealing some cream and a silver platter.

The snapping continues.

>We get the cream. Kept around to go with the coffee. It doesn't seem to have gone off yet, which is a wonder.

The snapping continues.

>We reset the device to c. The cream gives way to the now-familiar ream.

>It's a quick walk.

The snapping continues.

The snapping continues.

>The paper-drawer slides back into place with a click.

The printer whirs as though clearing its throat, and then begins to spit pages rapidly into the output tray.

The snapping continues.

>We take the draft document. It's fifteen pages double-spaced, and appears to be the draft of a talk Professor Waterstone is preparing to give at a convention. I immediately notice, however, that several portions of the speech are marked with angry triple asterisks — Waterstone's way of marking up parts of text that need serious revision.

The talk concerns "homonym shame": the anxiety felt in the Victorian era, and still manifested at times in modern culture, about objects that shared the same name as (and therefore theoretically might be converted into) something rude. Methods of disguising the legs of pianos and crotches of trees occupy a good portion of Waterstone's exposition, and there is a page-long aside on methods of  making sure that donkeys are known by that name and not by the alternative.

To judge, however, from the angry asterisking, Waterstone is still looking for at least one more example of an object susceptible to double-entendre that has been successfully rendered innocent by some linguistic modification.

The snapping continues.

Higgate's office
Higgate got about 30% finished with a stylish decorating scheme and then got distracted, leaving everything in a unsettled state. A few of her books are arranged on a very nice rosewood bookshelf, which looks Asian and is ornamented with small figurines; all the rest of her library is stacked higgledy-piggledy in plastic cartons.

Professor Higgate is sitting at an oval table, on which are spread an ugly yellow book, a sugar bowl, a teapot, and a romance novel in some heavily accented language. Higgate is the second reader on my dissertation committee, and a conlang expert — that is, Constructed Languages. It was a seminar with her that really got me thinking about utopian linguistics, and she's been very supportive, though cautious. She and Professor Waterstone don't always get along that well.

She looks up when we come in. ".i xu do se bangu la lojban." Higgate asks. She's asking whether we speak Lojban. For the present, I think it will raise fewer questions if we say no.

The snapping continues.

>"I'm afraid I don't understand," we say, smiling faintly.

Her face falls. "Ah! I was hoping you'd be here for Conversational Lojban Tea." The room is conspicuously lacking other Lojban conversationalists.

The snapping continues.

I'd like to ask how Professor Higgate is doing.

>"How are you?" we ask.

Forgive me these irrelevant questions, but I haven't seen Professor Higgate for a few days, and she's one of my favorite people in the department. I worry about her a little.

She looks taken aback, as though trying to figure out whether she knows us. Then she shrugs this off and decides to proceed as though she does.

"Oh, you know," she says. "It's that time of year when the energy's run out and the students have to be prodded with an electric rod to get them to do any work. And then I've got this book I've got to write, and Professor Waterstone keeps talking about how next year he would like to take a break from being Director of Graduate Studies..."

The snapping continues.

We want to ask what would be so bad about directing graduate studies.

>"What would be so bad about being director of graduate studies?" I ask, a little surprised. I always thought she liked graduate students.

"Nothing, nothing! It's just that I have this book I should be writing, and Professor Waterstone has done the job for so many years that he's—"

She pulls up short, apparently remembering that she doesn't, actually, know us at all. "He's very experienced, and I am not sure he would enjoy watching someone else do it differently," she concludes tactfully. "Our personal styles are not very similar."

There's a brief pause. "I'd offer you some cucumber sandwiches," Professor Higgate says. "But I'm afraid I ate them all."

The snapping continues.

We could ask whether she might let us into the language studies seminar room, ask how we might return a book, or ask which conlangs she knows.

>"Could you possibly let me into the Language Studies Seminar Room?" we ask. "There's something I'd like to do in there."

"Er... Do you have some student ID or something? You see, and this is a little embarrassing, I'm afraid I'm not quite placing you at the moment, and I'm not supposed to allow students into that room unless they have some affiliation with the department."

Of course we don't have any ID, and no prospect of getting any. But she might be persuaded by some other evidence of affiliation.

The snapping continues.

We could ask how we might return a book or ask which conlangs she knows.

>"I need to return this book to the department library," we say, holding out The Problem of Adjectives.

"Oh! Yes, all right," she says. "Did you like it? It's a good overview of the subject, didn't you think? I'm afraid the author once annoyed Professor Waterstone at a conference, or we might have had her around to speak at one of our colloquia..."

Higgate stands, patting herself down as though worried she has forgotten something.

"After you," says Higgate. "I assume it's safe to leave for a minute; if anyone is coming for Lojban Tea we'll see them in the hall." She walks past us through the office door.

We walk a little behind Higgate, who has a very long businesslike stride despite her heels.

She fiddles with her keys for a moment before finding the right one. "Here we you go," she says, pushing the door open.

She steps inside.

Language Studies Seminar Room
They recently redid this room, and whoever picked the decorations had postmodern tastes.

Professor Higgate waits a little absent-mindedly nearby, looking over the bookshelf. On the bookshelf are History of the Standards Revolution and Lives of the Lexicographers. 

A massive plexiglas case takes up one corner of the room. In the plexiglas case is a compact but high-powered late model synthesizer. 

The big table at the center of the room is an irregular polygon, with one chair pushed up to the shortest side. I think the shape is intended to undermine traditional conceptions of academic hierarchy, but in practice it  just means that whoever gets to seminar late has to sit with a table angle jabbing him in the stomach.

The snapping continues.

We could ask which conlangs she knows.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now forty-eight.]

>We take a moment to find the proper place for the book.

The sound of discussion comes from down the hall: two voices speaking in Lojban, and then a male voice interrupting. "Do you have a license for this conversation?" it asks.

"Excuse me," Higgate says. "I'd better go see to that."

She waves and heads back northeast.

The snapping continues.

[Your score has gone up by two points and is now fifty.]

>We walk. 

Brown's Lab
Professor Brown, the Reification of Abstracts researcher, is hunched over his work table. Brown is only barely a professor at all — actually, his working title is Senior Lecturer, and he holds a yearly contract which the University has the option to renew at whim. This prevents him going elsewhere while ensuring that he never has a fully-funded lab of his own. All the electrical equipment down here is tinker-toys compared to the stuff he really wants; in fact, half of it he built himself with components he bought with his own money.

I know all this because Brown cornered me in the hallway one afternoon and talked to me for twenty minutes straight about the pressures of academic job-hunting in the current political climate. I tried to get him to stop, but he's like a wind-up toy.

"Don't touch anything, please," he says, without looking up.

The snapping continues.

We want to ask what he is doing.

>"What are you up to there?" we ask. Asking Brown questions when he's working is a bit of a crap-shoot, I tell you now.

He wiggles his nose back and forth. I knew him for three months before I figured out what the wiggle is: it is his hands-free way of working his spectacles back up his nose when they start to slide down. 

Without looking at us, he says, "I'm getting ready to do a new calibration run on 'love'." 

This is a favorite of his, because you can get it so easily from a glove, so the materials are inexpensive.

The snapping continues.

We could ask what love looks like or ask how Professor Brown makes abstracts.

>"What does love look like, then?" we ask, as though I hadn't seen this a bunch of times already.

"It varies," Professor Brown replies. "The manifestation of a complex concept depends on a variety of circumstances; by default if multiple concepts are available, the letter tool will produce whichever concept requires least energy to produce, but in cases where several concepts are indistinguishably popular, the results are apparently random.

"Recent research suggests that the outcome can be influenced by the language community surrounding the operation and even by the intention of the tool's user (to a limited degree); but I am not interested in pursuing those angles at present." 

There: Professor Brown in a nutshell. Did he tell you anything you wanted to know? No.

The deal is that manifestations of "love" tend to look like stuff you'd find on a greeting card: roses, hearts, kiss symbols. Every once in a while you get something a little more platonic. But it's a let-down, if you want to know the truth. Most significant abstracts are like that: all you get by reifying them is a popular visualization. 

The snapping continues.

My response would be to ask how Professor Brown makes abstracts.

>"What equipment do you use to make your abstracts?" we ask.

"It's an ordinary letter-remover with a few adjustments," Brown says. "The department's computer can lift some of the legal overrides on standard letter tools. The job would be easier if I had access to higher-powered machinery, but..."

The snapping continues.

My response would be to ask whether he can fix the letter-remover.

>"Could you fix my letter-remover to make abstract objects as well?"

"It's not difficult, you just— oh, stay here, I'm not supposed to bring students into the rectification room."

He takes the letter-remover and steps out into the hallway. I can hear him using his keycard on the door, going into the little room west of the hallway, doing something there. (Don't bother thinking we're going to cosh him and take the keycard. I'm sure there's a better way, and I don't cosh people.)

He comes back in a minute.

"There," he says. "Should be abstract-enabled now."

The snapping continues.

I'm inclined to ask what he thinks of the letter-remover or thank Professor Brown.

[Your score has gone up by three points and is now fifty-three.]

>"Is there anything else that could be done to upgrade my letter-remover?" we ask naively.

"Nothing I can help you with, I'm afraid," he says. "There are some safety overrides that could be programmed out, allowing you to make living creatures, but that's..." He does his spasmodic shrug. "One of those things where I think the laws have a point. It's dangerous and possibly even cruel."

The snapping continues.

We could ask why reifying living creatures is cruel or thank Professor Brown.

>"Why would it be cruel to make a living creature?" you ask.

"We don't know whether such creations have awareness and sensation like other creatures," he says. "If they do, it is horrible to bring them into existence only to send them out again."

The snapping continues.

Samuel Johnson Basement
Dank and malodorous: there are no windows down here, and the drainage is terrible.

The stairs up are here; the lecture room at the east. Immediately south is the Graduate Student Office, and southwest is Professor Brown's office. The most interesting of all is the small door west, trying to look inconspicuous, but locked with a keycard lock: it's where the department stores its most dangerous licensed equipment.

A large open carton stands against the wall right between Brown's lab door and the interesting door. "Recycling," reads the sign over the carton. "Place your lab-created items here for processing." There is a banana in the large carton. 

The snapping continues.

>
Graduate Student Office
A small windowless room divided into cubicles for individual graduate students.

A tiny refrigerator stores lunches (sometimes) and looted leftovers from department receptions (when available). The door is currently open, revealing a silver platter (littered with the remains of a party, including a crumpled cocktail napkin and a shrimp tail). On top of the fridge there is a coffee-maker.

My cubicle is the one with the swivel-chair, towards the back of the room by the water cooler. 

The snapping continues.

>I don't know what you think you're talking about, because we can't see any such thing here.

>We have a short walk. 

University Oval
This is the center of the university, a broad grassy oval shaded with sycamore trees and surrounded by buildings in brick or white stone.

Immediately south of here is the building where I spend most of my time, Samuel Johnson Hall. 

A sign lies on the grass, abandoned by its owner. 

The snapping continues.

>We reset the device to g. With a distinct whiff of sulfur, the sign turns into a sin. An abstract representation of willfully clueless meddling. Not a sin known to Dante, perhaps; but modern democracies have their own forms of wrong-doing.

Fleur d'Or Lobby
The Fleur d'Or is a high-end hotel that serves businessmen and luxury tourists interested in the linguistic mechanisms of the island. As a result, it has all kinds of paid exemptions, including an exemption allowing it to operate under a foreign name.

The spotlights in the ceiling light the floor in distinct pools of Bureau blue, and a sheet of frosted glass etched with random letters separates the lobby from the drinks club to the west.

There is no one at the glossy piano in the corner, though a piece has been left on the piano bench. 

The snapping continues.

>That was a rhetorical question.

The snapping continues.

Fleur d'Or Drinks Club
The back wall is dramatically decorated with bottled liquors of all sorts, from gin to cachaça; there's a giant bottle of Campari, taller than your average three-year-old, with a red ribbon around its neck.

What makes this place technically a drinks club rather than a bar is its license to serve letter-manufactured food and drink. A toolkit on the bar contains some screwdrivers, some gimlets, and some rusty nails, ready to be transformed into their respective cocktails.

Aside from Mark at the bar, most of the patrons are seated at tables. 

The bartender and Mark are still talking about the homonym paddle. The other patrons are scattered around the room at small tables, drinking or talking among themselves. 

"Hello," the bartender says.

"That was a little dangerous, wasn't it?" Mark asks. "If you had tapped me with that thing, wouldn't I be a giant X on the carpet now?"

"Not for long," the bartender says. "I do have some restoration gel for emergencies. Or I could just hit you again with the paddle. But there would be an incident report and I could lose my license. So, yeah, better not."

The snapping continues.

>(from the bartender)
We order a screwdriver.

The bartender fishes around in the toolkit for a screwdriver and sets it on the bar with a flourish. Mark is watching this transaction in an interested way.

"This is good," says the bartender, winking at us both (all?). "You'll like this." She raises the homonym paddle unnecessarily high in the air and smashes it down hard on the screwdriver.

There's a crackling discharge of purple-toned lightning, and in place of the screwdriver, a cocktail of the same name now sits on the bar. A few of the customers applaud.

"Just the way you were imagining it, guaranteed."

The snapping continues.

>We get the Screwdriver. A cocktail of fresh-squeezed orange juice and vodka. It is hardly the grandest of cocktails, but it will do.

A businesswoman comes up to the bar for directions to the nearest restroom.

The snapping continues.

>We have a brief drive over to Long Street South. There we pull easily into one of the available parking spots, since many people have now gone home.

Next we hike. 

Language Studies Seminar Room
They recently redid this room, and whoever picked the decorations had postmodern tastes.

The bookshelves lining the walls contain the department library. On the bookshelf are The Problem of Adjectives, History of the Standards Revolution, and Lives of the Lexicographers. 

A massive plexiglas case takes up one corner of the room. In the plexiglas case is a compact but high-powered late model synthesizer. 

The big table at the center of the room is an irregular polygon, with one chair pushed up to the shortest side. 

I shut the door so that we don't get interrupted.

The snapping continues.

>We just touch a coated fingertip of gel to the Screwdriver. With an audible SPLORT, the Screwdriver becomes a screwdriver. The screwdriver is flat-headed, with a red plastic handle and a sturdy shaft.

The snapping continues.

>The plexiglas case is locked.

The snapping continues.

>We squeeze ourselves against the wall and angle to reach the screws with the screwdriver. I start on the first screw when—

"Is someone in the Seminar Room?" asks a male voice in the hall. "I thought I heard something."

"I don't think so."

There's a listening silence from outside. We hold absolutely still.

Finally the footsteps move away again. It's probably safe to try again now, when I'm feeling a tiny bit calmer.

The snapping continues.

>We awkwardly and silently squeeze against the wall and angle ourself so that we can reach the screws with the screwdriver. It's annoying work, but eventually we do work all the screws free enough that the case could be opened.

The snapping continues.

>We open the plexiglas case.

>We put the key into the synthesizer.

The snapping continues.

>We make the quick hike. 

Long Street South
Long Street is lined on each side with a double-row of tall, anemic palm trees that bend towards one another many feet overhead. We are now in the southern part of this long corridor, between the Canadian Embassy and Arbot Maps & Antiques.

Someone has left a shopping bag at the roadside — maybe by accident when loading up a car, maybe because they mean to come back for it. The shopping bag contains a ball and a jigsaw. 

Our car is parked nearby. 

We can go north, south to Palm Square, and west to Arbot Maps & Antiques from here.

The snapping continues.

>We dip out a pea-sized quantity of gel and rub it gently onto the car. With an audible SPLORT, the car becomes some chard. 

The snapping continues.

>We reset the device to h. The chard gives way to the card. This time it's the Magician. A man stands over a table of delicate instruments: letter-razors, reversing mirrors, decapitalization disambiguators. He is putting on a performance, though we cannot see his audience.

The snapping continues.

>We get the card.

The snapping continues.

>It's a short walk.

A massive plexiglas case takes up one corner of the room. In the plexiglas case is a compact but high-powered late model synthesizer. There are a key and a crossword in the compact but high-powered late model synthesizer. 

The big table at the center of the room is an irregular polygon, with one chair pushed up to the shortest side. 

We can also see some screws here. 

For safety, I shut the door behind us.

Before we go through the door to the Rectification Room, it occurs to us that Professor Brown is just next door, and that he is likely to be able to hear if we do anything in there. Possibly some kind of masking noise is in order.

The snapping continues.

>We reset the device to t. We get the letter.

There is a flash of psychedelic colors, and the letter turns into a leer. It is a good-humored, slightly-drunk kind of leer, but it's unmistakable.

The snapping continues.

>We have a lengthy hike out from under the sycamores in the Oval and up Long Street as far as the Monumental Staircase. From there we have an invigorating climb up, with the view of the sea getting better and better as we go (but of course looking requires stopping to gaze back over our shoulder).

Next it's a brief walk from the kitschy splendor of the fair along the old walls and into the placid sunlight among the villas of the rich. 

Roget Close
A pleasantly sheltered lane in which I learned to ride a bicycle, and where my friend Lucy used to live, before she and her parents moved off-island. Restrictions were looser even twenty years ago. Our old schoolhouse is just west of here.

If you look just north between the houses, you'll notice also the footpath down to an almost-private beach. It used to be open, but it's now gated off, and built into the gate is a chic modern sculpture. 

The snapping continues.

You have a fleeting thought of your crew's skill.

>We put the leer on the pedestal.

The mirror rotates in leisurely fashion, and when it is done there is a reel.

The sort of reel used on a fishing rod, the kind with a handle you can crank to pull in the line. But as there is neither line nor rod available, it doesn't actually offer much functionality like this.

The snapping continues.

>We get the reel.

The bartender is pouring tequila shots for a guest. 

"Hi there," the bartender says.

The snapping continues.

>"Check this out," we say, holding out the reel for inspection.

She shrugs good-naturedly, hits the reel with the paddle, and grins at us. We look down at what we're holding: A reel of film, unlabeled.

Mark looks thoughtfully into his gin and tonic. "I hear that sometimes the Bureau turns people into inanimate objects as a criminal sentence. Is that true?"

For the first time, the bartender looks uncomfortable. "I just pour the drinks," she says. "Hey, you're almost out there! Let me give you a refill." And she busies herself getting down the Bombay Sapphire and refilling his drink.

"You ever tempted to paddle the Sapphire?" Mark asks. "Should be worth a lot."

"Alas, jewelers tend to check for authenticity around here," she replies.

The snapping continues.

>We make the fair walk to the Monumental Staircase. From there we have a healthy climb up, with the view of the sea getting better and better as we go.

Next it's a quick walk pushing through the dense crowds. 

Screening Room
Whatever is scheduled for later showing has not started yet, and is probably not destined to start for some time; at any rate, the screen is blank and no audience has yet assembled.

We can go north to the Projection Booth and east to the Cinema Lobby from here.

The snapping continues.

Projection Booth
The booth is small and lined with grey carpet. It smells faintly of hot dogs.

A projector has been set up facing the screen. 

The snapping continues.

>We put the reel into the projector.

The snapping continues.

>(the projector on)
We flip the switch. The projector comes to life with a hum. There's the usual flickering of light and dust, and then a black and white movie begins to play.


Achievement accomplished: Lucius Quagmire award for viewing unusual films!
A jolly title card comes up, which reads "Ostereier".

The scene opens on a nurse in wartime uniform reading aloud from a small black book that looks much battered. Afterward, a teenaged boy finds an Atlantean flag — one of the old style from before the second World War — and tears it into strips.
